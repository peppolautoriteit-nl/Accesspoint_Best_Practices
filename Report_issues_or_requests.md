## Reporting issues or change requests

You can report issues or requests with either the Issues link above, or by forking the repository and creating a Pull Request. 
See the paragraph below for details on how to add your changes to a file and push the changes to the NPa by using Github in your browser.
Alternatively, you can send a direct request to the NPa by email [operations@peppolautoriteit.nl](mailto:operations@peppolautoriteit.nl). No rights can be derived from submissions.

The final result of this process will be submitted to the Service Provider community for approval.

## Adding changes to a file using the online Github editor 

Create a Github account and login.

Find the repository that contains the project that you want to work on.

A repository can contains files and folders. A folder will most likely contain more files.

Click on a filename to open the file. Click the Edit icon to start editing the file.

If you do not have your own copy of the repository yet, Github will inform you that it has created a "Fork".
A fork means you have your private copy of the project that you want to work on.

Now you can edit the file. If you are working on a .MD (markdown) file you can use the following webpage to help you with creating specific formatting:

After you have made your changes in your private copy of the project, you can push your changes to the repository of the Netherlands Peppol Authority.
Give your change request a name and some explanatory text before clicking the "Propose changes" button.

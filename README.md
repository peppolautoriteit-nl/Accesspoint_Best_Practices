# Accesspoint_Best_Practices

A collection of best practices for running a Peppol Access Point.

The main document in this repository is [Access_Points_Best_Practices.md](./Access_Points_Best_Practices.md).

This is a work-in-progress live document. It is currently in an early draft; essentially a partly random collection of best practices that have been submitted by several service providers.

Instructions on how to request additions or changes can be found [here](./Report_issues_or_requests.md).
